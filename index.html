      <h1>How One Button Can Save Your Life*</h1>
      <i>
        Juxtaposed against time, a signal emerges into the ether — the language
        of the wire — born from the simplest of actions: the press of a single
        button.
      </i>

      <p>
        Long before computers processed the ones and zeros that define our
        modern world, we decoded information in much the same way. Morse code
        and the telegraph became a new medium of communication. Simple, fast,
        and far-reaching, they allowed people to exchange information across
        great distances in near real time — something that continues to shape
        our world today.

      <p>
        Become part of that history and take a moment to learn this terse
        signal: three dots, three dashes, three dots. A dot is short. A dash is
        longer. Press the button or use the space bar to try it yourself.

        Known as the international distress signal (aka, SOS), this message can
        be transmitted through almost any medium — sound, light, or even touch.
        This app models the telegraph: a single button and a 675 Hz audible
        tone. Learn this code and you will always have a universal way to ask
        for help. One button (*and your own wits) can save your life.
